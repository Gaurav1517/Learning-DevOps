CentOS 8 reached end-of-life (EOL) on December 31, 2021, and its repositories were moved to vault.centos.org, which 
no longer has DNS resolution by default. You have a few options to fix this issue:

Option 1: Use CentOS Vault (Recommended for EOL CentOS 8)
You need to update your repository configuration to use the CentOS Vault.

Move the old repository files:

bash
mkdir -p /etc/yum.repos.d/old-repos
mv /etc/yum.repos.d/CentOS-* /etc/yum.repos.d/old-repos/
Create a new repo file:

bash

cat <<EOF > /etc/yum.repos.d/centos-vault.repo
[BaseOS]
name=CentOS-8 - Base
baseurl=http://vault.centos.org/centos/8/BaseOS/x86_64/os/
gpgcheck=1
enabled=1
gpgkey=file:///etc/pki/rpm-gpg/RPM-GPG-KEY-centosofficial

[AppStream]
name=CentOS-8 - AppStream
baseurl=http://vault.centos.org/centos/8/AppStream/x86_64/os/
gpgcheck=1
enabled=1
gpgkey=file:///etc/pki/rpm-gpg/RPM-GPG-KEY-centosofficial

[extras]
name=CentOS-8 - Extras
baseurl=http://vault.centos.org/centos/8/extras/x86_64/os/
gpgcheck=1
enabled=1
gpgkey=file:///etc/pki/rpm-gpg/RPM-GPG-KEY-centosofficial
